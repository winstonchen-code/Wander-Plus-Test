      For starters, among our staff and independent contractor travel consultants located locally and in several states, we have been to every continent in the world, and sailed on nearly every cruise line catering to the American market. We don't just talk about the destinations and cruise lines we sell. We have experienced them!

What is more, we have been in business for 14 years. Our success speaks for itself (more on that in a minute). But apart from that success, the most rewarding aspect of this business for us -- more than the awards and recognition we've achieved -- is the relationships we have forged along the way. But for this business, we would not have met so many of the people we now count among our friends -- people that started as clients who now are people with whom we socialize and travel regularly with. It's these personal connections that have enriched the past 10 years the most for us.

We have a true passion for this travel. We love piecing together a custom travel experience for our clients -- tailored around the clients' interests. One that will allow them to experience entirely new destinations in a truly enriching way, and experience destinations they have visited before in an entirely different way. Few things are more rewarding to us than a client who returns from a trip to let us know that their experience was remarkable...one that they will always cherish and remember.

Our business is not a call center. Our professionals don't believe in just being a booking portal. We want to get to know you so that we can deliver an experience to you like no other. We work with clients across the United States, throughout Canada, and across the globe, but each of our clients share one thing in common -- they value a personal touch and the expertise we provide.

As a result of our growing number of loyal clients, we have achieved remarkable success. For 7 consecutive years, we have achieved Connoisseur Club status with Oceania Cruises. That means we are one of Oceania Cruises' top 50 travel agency partners throughout North America. We also are a preferred account with nearly every other major cruise line serving the North American market place -- Silversea, Crystal, Uniworld, Viking River Cruises, Holland American Line, Cunard Line, Princess Cruises, Celebrity Cruises, Windstar Cruises, Seabourn, and others. We have called upon and quoted for our travel expertise by national publications, including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and USA Today.

Give us a call today toll free at 866-368-7327 or 703-980-2144. Let us help you experience the world the way you want to experience it!      </text>
